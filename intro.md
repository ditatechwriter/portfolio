# Welcome!

I'm Michael McLoughlin and I am a technical writer and techical course developer with roughly 15 years experience - principally in the cybersecurity and fintech industries.

This website is my shop window and also a space for my writings on aspects of technical writing that interest me.

I have a passion for all aspects of technical writing, information architectures, and the whole publication process for software technical documentation.

If you're a recruiter you'll find links to my LinkedIn profile, and my resum√© in PDF format at the top of the page.

If you are looking for sample of writing, take a look at articles on this site. If you are more interested in seeing work I have done professionally, [contact me](mailto:michael@ditatechwriter.com) directly and I can point your towards my writing and videos on the web.

## About this site

For those interested in the tool chain behind the site:

- The site is in written in Lightweight DITA - primarily in the markdown-flavored variant, MDITA.
- I use a range of tools for writing this site - principally Oxygen XML Editor, also sometimes Visual Studio Code, and even a simple markdown editor app on my Kindle for quick updates.
- Even though the site source content is written basically in Markdown, it also uses some HTML5 and XML to perform some content resuse magic, so I use the DITA Open Toolkit to build the final output content - which is also Markdown.
- The content is stored in a GitHub repository and I use Github Actions to build and lint the output. I also use GitHub actions to send my Slack message when builds linting jobs fail.
- The actual website you site is created using the Docsify static site generator (SSG) - a full featured, easy-to-configure JavaScript framework specifically for technical documentation.
- Finally, the site hosted on Netlify whose webhooks publish the site every time it builds successfully.
