# Docs-as-code 2.0

A docs-as-code approach as it is usually deployed in software companies today has several significant challenges.

If the docs are written in simple Markdown, scalability, and content maintenance become a problem when used outside of simple single-product projects.

If a more sophisticated solution like AsciiDoc or DITA is used, then ease of writing, writer training, and document reviews is lost, These solutions often come with significant cost overheads in the form of specialized software purchases and consultancy fees. Converting documentation to these more complex formats is, my experience, often a long and difficult task, involving much manual updating and a lot of writer training.

But what if we could have the sophisticated functionality of DITA, Docbook or AsciiDoc, and still write our docs in Markdown with pretty much all the ease of implementation, use and reviews that brings? 

What if we could filter our Markdown content, reuse it wherever we liked, and have text variables too?

Well... you can! The coming Lightweight DITA (LwDITA) 1.0 standard brings all of those features to plain old Markdown content, allowing scalability, and ease of maintenance, without sacrificing ease of use.
